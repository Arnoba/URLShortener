					<h3>URL Shortener</h3>
					<p>This page was created as a main group project in our Server Side Development course. Object of
						this project was to colaberate in a team enviorment and create a web app which fullfilled certain
						requirements. We choose to build the suggested URL shortener to simulate a real world enviorment
						where projects are often assignment rather than built from scatch by preference. The web app includes 
						functions such as URL shortening, searching, some statistical tests and more.</p>
					<h3>About us</h3>
					<h4>Arno Bacher</h4>
					<p>My name is Arno Bacher and I was born in Itay 1991. At the age of 2 I moved to Canada where I lived for 
						10 years. During my young childhood my interest in computers and electronic devices was sparked by my 
						first gaming console the Sega Genesis (also known as Mega Drive). To this day gaming is one of my hobbies 
						and has helped increase my knowledge of computer hardware and software. Around the age of 8 my family had
						bought its first computer. After several computer breakdowns caused by an interested child who had to click 
						every possible button and link I could successfully operate the computer and knew all I needed to know to 
						increase my knowledge of computers. Another key factor for developing my skills was my brother who did things 
						the right way and read up on lots of the computer topic and shared his knowledge with me. </p>
					<p>At the age of 13 I moved back to Italy where I completed a business focused high school. My passion for 
						computers was not integrated in school but from my own interest I learned some basic programming and 
						scripting. After trying a wide variety of computer science related topics like 3D modelling with programs 
						like blender, programming with languages like c and c++ I decided to seek a future in computer science. 
						Therefor I moved to Dublin where my brother was studying computer science in Dublin Institute Technology. 
						Web design is a new aspect I hadn’t had experience with until I started my computer science course in 
						Griffith College 2013.</p>
					<h4>Eirik Clausen</h4>
					<p>My name is Eirik Clausen. I'm a 23 years old boy, born and raised in Norway, Drammen. When I was 5 years old I 
						went to Bragernes elementary school in Drammen till I was 12 years old. In Norway we got 7 years in 
						elementary school, 3 years in junior high, and 3 years in senior high. During this time, I did a lot of 
						different sports, football (soccer), Ice hockey, bandy, gymnastic and tennis, but with football on focus. 
						After elementary school, I went to Børresen junior high school for 3 years, in Drammen. At this point my 
						soccer team got disbanded and I only played tennis. When I graduated from junior high school, I chose to go 
						to a private senior high school for 3 years, in Drammen. After graduation of this school, I wasn't sure what 
						I wanted to do, so I went to a folk high school in Mosjøen (north of Norway) for one year. This is a type of 
						school which is very common in Norway. The school last for 1 year, and you don't have any homework, tests, 
						assignment or exams. You are there just to be social and do different kind of activities. I chose the sport 
						course, and it was a very good year of my life. After this, I went to Buskerud college to study business and 
						administration.</p>
					<p>At first I wanted to study in England, but because Norway is not in EU, it would cost a lot to go there. 
						However, I could get an EU deal in Ireland. I wanted to try out a big city with a lot of students, so 
						naturally Dublin was the optimal for me. I was searching through a lot of websites and I thought 
						Griffith Collage Dublin looked the most interesting, so i ended up applying for this school. When I 
						finally got the answer that I got in, I was really happy, and so was my family.</p>	
					<h4>Jogn Michael Panopio</h4>
					<p>My name is John Michael Panopio. I live in Blanchardstown Dublin 15. I came to Ireland when I was 9 years of age 
						along with my two siblings.My parents were here in Ireland before me and my siblings. I went to primary 
						school in St.Brigids boys school. I went to Coolmine Community School for secondary. Now I attend Griffith 
						College and currently doing a bachelors degree in Computing science. I chose Computing science because 
						i have always dreamed of working in IT industry its one of my goal to work for companies like Facebook, 
						Google. Another reason I chose computing science is I want to be able to learn more about how technology 
						that we use in today age work.</p>
